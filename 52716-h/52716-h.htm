<p>As meat is one of the most important items of American diet, its price is
a matter of moment to every housewife. Comparisons between the cost of live
animals and the price per pound of meat sometimes lead to the conclusion that
the existing margin is too wide and that possibly the profits of the middleman are
too large.</p>

<p>After fair analysis, the housewife realizes that a live animal is not all meat
and, furthermore, that the meat carcass is not all steaks and rib roasts. A comparison,
therefore, between the live cost of meat animals per pound and the cost
per pound of a tenderloin is misleading, if it results in any conclusions relative
to margins.</p>

<p>Then we must reckon with the wide difference in grades of meat. We cannot
correctly estimate the cost of a steak cut from a prime beef by that of a steak
from a grass-fed cow. There are several grades of meat, depending upon the
nature and feeding, each wholesome and nutritious, but some demanding more
special cooking than others.</p>

<p>About fifty-five per cent of a steer is meat; the remainder includes the hide
and various other by-products, which, except the hide, are not worth in their
primary state anywhere near as much per pound as they cost alive. The fifty-five
per cent of the animal which is meat must, therefore, carry the greater portion
of the original cost. That is why a steer carcass might be sold by the packer for
twenty cents a pound and still fail to pay a profit, even though the live animal
cost the packer only twelve cents a pound. The casual observer, noting a difference
of eight cents a pound between the live animal and the carcass, might say a
sixty-six per cent increase in price is unduly large; but a little deeper study develops
that the return from the carcass in this instance would fail to equal the
amount paid for the live steer.</p>

<p>When a retailer buys a carcass, he purchases neck meat as well as loins; chucks
as well as rounds. Portions of the carcass have to be sold at or sometimes less
than he paid per pound for the carcass. The choice cuts necessarily have to
make up for the losses on the less desirable portions. It is not unreasonable, therefore,
that the retailer should charge fifty or sixty cents a pound for choice steaks
and fifteen cents a pound for boiling beef out of a carcass which he bought at the
rate of twenty cents a pound.</p>

<p>Only the aggregate price which the retailer gets for all parts and portions of
the carcass will show his margin over the initial cost. It is wholly improper,
therefore, to compare sixty-cent steaks with twelve-cent cattle with a view to
determining profit.</p>

<p>The same thing is true of hogs and of sheep. A hog is not all meat, nor is the meat
all ham. A sheep is not all carcass and only a small part of the carcass cuts up into
chops. One must know the aggregate return and something about the costs of doing
business before a justifiable conclusion as to price margins can be determined.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE home managers have in their hands the most important
business of the nation. American women
realize that to their duties as home makers, mothers,
and guiding influences, is added an important economic
responsibility. The manner in which the purchasing power
of twenty million home managers is used has an inestimable
effect upon the production, collection, and distribution
of all products in the market.</p>

<p>This second edition of “The Business of Being a
Housewife” is respectfully dedicated to the thousands of
wise home managers who are determined to understand
more fully their relation to the producers of the country
and to the great industries, such as that of Armour and
Company, who have made possible the providing of perfect
food in perfect condition at any distance from the
farm.</p>


<div class="sidenote">ECONOMIC
CHANGES</div>

<p>A study of the national and world situation
on food production shows that old-time low
food prices may never return. Formerly
much of the food was raised by numerous individual
families on Government land at nominal cost; today practically
all food is raised on expensive land—the plains
have been turned into villages and farms by the increasing
population. Many men and expensive machinery and
equipment are needed to produce our present high standard
products.</p>

<p>It became economically unsound for so great a percentage
of food producers to spend their time in producing
meats and staples, only part of which could be consumed
by themselves and their near neighbors, the rest going to
waste. The great waste of the surplus products set the
minds of men of genius to devising ways to preserve the
foods of abundant harvests for the seasons of scarcity.
The result is before us in the form of modern cold-storage
plants, refrigerator cars, volume-curing and pickling of
meat products, and volume-canning of fish, meats, fruits,
and vegetables; great cereal factories, etc.</p>

<p>The standard of quality has been raised and the sanitary
handling of foods greatly developed. While this has
increased the prices a little, it has also increased the efficiency
and earning power of the consumer and has tended
towards the better health of the nation. The only way
to equalize prices, for the high quality of foods demanded
by discriminating home managers, is through efficient
commercial handling and the conservation of every bit
of material. While the efficiency of the Armour organization
is regarded as of the highest standard, the organization
is continually striving to still further increase this
efficiency.</p>

<p>Armour and Company act as a great service link
between the farmers and consumers. Through our agricultural
department we reach out to the farmer and advise
him in producing the best meat animals and farm products
within his farm’s possibilities. We assist him to improve
his soil and to feed his animals to the best advantage.</p>

<p>The raw material buyers for Armour and Company
are all experts in their special lines. They search the
markets to select the best products for each branch of our
service. Then various corps of specialists analyze and
prepare the foods in the most efficient, scientific, and satisfactory
way for the consumer. Through able management
the most expert service today goes into the translating of
a meat animal into wholesome U.S. Government inspected
meat, either fresh, smoked, dried, prepared, or canned.</p>


<div class="sidenote">BUY FOR
REAL
VALUE</div>

<p>Expensive experimenting with foods may
be eliminated from your accounts by the
simple method of buying by known brands.
Label reading is today’s most important
buying guide. A dealer soon learns the wants of his quality
buyers, and, knowing your demand for high standard
commercially prepared foods, he will be careful to select
correspondingly good quality foods when replenishing his
stock.</p>

<p>Every careful home maker demands that the meat she
buys, whether fresh, smoked, dried, cured, or canned, bears a
U. S. Government inspected-and-passed label, and should
demand canned foods marketed under a reliable firm name.</p>

<p>Standards of purity and quality in the preparation of
commercial foods have gradually raised, until now there is
practically every food for every need in convenient sanitary
packages at your corner market under a quality label
guarantee.</p>

<p>Drudgery has been literally taken out of food preparation.
Madam Home Manager’s time may now well be employed
along more constructive lines than in shelling peas
and stringing beans. Hers is the responsibility and privilege
of selecting foods for her family’s menus in such
combinations that every food-need of the body is supplied
in proper proportion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DO YOU KNOW
FOOD VALUES?</div>

<p>This is one of the most serious matters
before us today, and the physicians
of the entire country are deploring
the fact that many of the children of the wealthy as
well as of the poor are undernourished. Do you know foods?
Prepared foods release you from less important tasks, that
you may have time to learn food values. It rests with
the responsible housewife to plan her own time so as to
achieve the greatest returns in the health and efficiency
of her family. Food knowledge means a better-fed nation.</p>

<p>A pantry stocked with a wide variety of quality foods
and a working knowledge of individual needs and food
values will make it possible for the home manager to prepare
the proper foods within her budget limitations.</p>


<div class="sidenote">PLAN YOUR
EXPENDITURES</div>

<p>A simple budget, or account keeping
system, is a necessity in every well-ordered,
successful business. The
world of today holds so many attractions that we must
carefully select those necessities and comforts that will
mean the most in real value to us, and then adhere to
that selection. The only way to know that we are following
our own plan is to have a simple accounting system. At
the end of the month, we should look over the figures
and decide upon the readjustments necessary. To insure
progress and stability, our monthly accounts should show
some savings and advancement expenditures.</p>

<p>We offer suggestions throughout this book, arranged
to help the average housewife solve her knotty home-managing
problems. We have been greatly assisted by
the women editors of national women’s publications,
prominent home economics teachers, and writers on vital
home subjects. This array of talent aims to make this
book of the greatest help possible to the American Housewife.</p>

<h3>ARMOUR PRODUCTS</h3>

<p>Many thousands of housewives have come to depend
upon the Armour Oval Label as a buying guide for a wide
variety of their pantry and refrigerator staples; they know
they can depend upon the uniformity and quality of every
Oval Label product.</p>

<p>Madam Home Manager receives the full benefit of our
fifty-some years of experience in caring for foods. She
has the Armour assurance of uniformity and quality and
is guided in her buying by the distinguishing quality Oval
Label.</p>

<p>We prepare and distribute with great efficiency, fresh,
smoked, cured, dried, prepared, and canned meats, all
Government inspected.</p>

<p>A full line of Armour shortenings and frying mediums,
as well as our economical oleomargarines and delicious
Cloverbloom Butter, may be secured from your dealer.
Salad oil under the Oval Label, as well as peanut butter,
will continue to meet with popular favor. The evaporated
milk and identifiable or carton eggs are considered indispensable
by the average home manager.</p>

<p>Cheese is becoming more and more favored for its
high food value, and it is with satisfaction that many learn
of the great variety of cheese sold under the Armour
guarantee of quality.</p>

<p>Armour’s Pork and Beans, Peanut Butter, Evaporated
Milk, Mince Meat, etc., are favorite products, and Madam
Home Manager will be able to obtain the well-established
Armour brands at her market.</p>

<p>Armour and Company maintain a well organized department
of Food Economics as a medium of expression
to the American housewife. This department is made up
of trained and experienced dietitians, teachers of home
economics, food chemists, practical home managers, writers
and lecturers.</p>

<p>We are equipped and prepared to give every home
maker the practical, technical and economic information
she may need on any food or home managing subject.</p>




<h3>THE PURPOSE OF THIS BOOK</h3>


<p>It is the purpose of this book to assist Madam Home
Manager in her mastery of the problems incident to the
feeding of a family for health, happiness and efficiency.</p>

<p>To simplify the presentation of this very important
material, we have divided the book into four sections:
Section one covers the apportionment of the income; Section
two deals with the wise selection of foods and the
place of each class of food in the building of a well-balanced
menu. Section three is devoted to fundamental
cookery suggestions. Section four holds for the reader a
wealth of general information to assist in simplifying the
labor of cookery.</p>

<p>As this is a manual of household efficiency and economy,
we have aimed to give the greatest possible number
of helpful suggestions, referring the reader to a number
of splendid cook books for recipes. (<i>See <a href="#Page_28">Page 28</a></i>)</p>

<h2 class="faux">MAKING YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE</h2>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 614px;">
<img src="images/i-004.jpg" width="614" height="75" alt="MAKING YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE" />
</div>

<p>Every home maker has a cherished ideal for the various
members of her family. The rapidity with which that
dream is realized depends upon how the family income
and individual energy are used. To those who have never
kept a record of expenditures, the first definite step toward
establishing a substantial financial basis and assuring progress
to the family is the keeping of an expense account.
Each day, make an accurate accounting of all expenditures.
Keep this carefully for four months, then, with that account
as a basis, plan your expenditures for the next four months
and live within that plan. The third quarter, keep your
expense account again and then you will have the accurate
information regarding the financial needs of your particular
family. After a careful analysis, make up a year’s
budget, cutting down non-essentials and adding to accounts
that really mean an advance step toward your goal.</p>

<p>The following percentages will serve as a guide showing
the possibilities of various incomes. Each family will
find it necessary to adjust the figures according to special
needs, local conditions and family ambitions. Special education
is worth economy in many lines, as it offers future
returns and is really an investment.</p>

<p>The food section of the Family Account Book is perhaps
the most important. Without properly prepared food
in proper combination, and quantity, we are not able to exercise
our greatest earning ability, to grasp new situations
as we should, or to invest our savings wisely. By keeping
the food account according to the body building uses of
the food purchased, we daily progress in our food knowledge
and become adepts at using alternative foods.</p>

<p>When one really operates a budget plan to win, it is an
advancement in itself. In cases of a large independent income
it is wise to have your banker’s representative work
out a budget for you. The budget outline, on <a href="#Page_6">page 6</a>, is
estimated for a family of five, one young child, two school
children, mother and father. Where the family is smaller,
the food and clothing accounts will change, the amount saved
going either to savings, investments, or advancements.</p>

<h3>FORM FOR YOUR FAMILY BUDGET</h3>

<p>Itemized Accounting of Expenditures and Percentage Apportionment of Income.</p>

<p>Estimated for Family of Five on $300 a Month. Percentages of Expenditures for Food, Operating and Contingency vary according to income.</p>

<p>The accompanying is a family budget outline that is easily adjustable
to entirely satisfactory use in your home. If the home manager,
by means of her ingenuity or by doing work herself, saves on the
regular scheduled expenditures, that money should go to her personal
account. Preparedness is a big factor in the growth of the
Home Manager’s credit column.</p>

<p>With this form as a guide, lay out your family budget outline,
in any ordinary notebook eight by eleven inches. Substitute your
own income and percentage figures, listing your needs under their
proper heads. As this outline is general, it may contain some suggestions
better fitted to your neighbor—just leave these items out of
your budget and add any others in their proper class.</p>

<p>The analysis of your needs and expenses necessary to make up
your very own budget is a great help toward keeping within your income
bounds.</p>

<p>Attach a pencil to your account book and keep it where you will
put down the day’s expenditures regularly each evening.</p>

<p>Make your budget a co-operative affair, soliciting suggestions
from the family as to what investments, savings, etc., to make.</p>

<h3>PROTEIN FOODS</h3>

<p>Food experts agree that 20 per cent. of the entire diet
should consist of protein. In our country, meat is the
favorite protein food. It provides a portion of the energy
which is also furnished by carbohydrates and fats, but its
chief purpose is to supply material for growth and repair
of the body tissues which are constantly worn out in the
performance of their various functions.</p>


<h4>FRESH BEEF</h4>

<p>Much of the frontier, upon which vast numbers of
cattle were formerly raised, is now cut up into small
farms and town lots. Hereafter, we must raise the greater
portion of our meat animals upon expensive land and feed.
The cost of production has increased many fold and consequently
meat is
higher in price.
Packers, through
utilizing by-products,
keep the
cost of wholesome
meat within the
reach of the consumer.</p>

<h2 class="faux">U.S. GOVERNMENT MEAT INSPECTION</h2>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 628px;">
<img src="images/i-011.jpg" width="628" height="78" alt="U.S. GOVERNMENT MEAT INSPECTION" />
</div>

<p>Every home manager should have a thorough understanding
of what U. S. Government Inspection of meat is—its
significance and importance in her selection of meats.
Practically everyone who has ever purchased meat has
noticed a round purple stamp, the size of a half dollar,
bearing the words “U. S. Inspected and Passed,” in the
center of the commercial cuts displayed.</p>

<p>The government stamp on the meat you purchase is
your absolute guarantee that the meat you are buying is
wholesome. It signifies that the animal from which that piece
of meat was cut had passed four separate inspections, and
that the meat was found to be free from all disease and in
perfect condition when it left the packing house.</p>

<p>Government meat inspection is one of the greatest
protections to the American table. Only concerns doing
interstate business offer this protection.</p>

<p>All meats have four inspections. The ante-mortem
inspection is termed “on the hoof.” The three post-mortem
inspections are made upon the glands of the neck, on
the viscera and on the dressed carcass.</p>

<p>Only about 60 per cent of the meat consumed in the
United States is United States Government inspected.
When the public shall demand that all meats be inspected,
we will have the much-needed nation-wide inspection, which
will insure wholesome meats for all. Women’s organizations
should make this movement a definite part of their
regular programs and consider it a duty to buy only U. S.
Government inspected meats.</p>

<p>The products of each packing house are identified by
the letter and number and the U. S. Gov’t Inspection mark
on each commercial cut.</p>


<h3>COLD STORAGE HELPS SOLVE THE
NATION’S FOOD PROBLEMS</h3>

<p>Cold storage is a great factor in the present solution
of the nation’s food problems. It is a means of holding
certain foods over from the season of plenty to the season
of scarcity. Since the first mechanical refrigeration was
installed in the late eighties, Government investigators have
been continually studying various methods of preserving
food, without canning, and all insist that there is no modern
method which equals cold storage. Understanding is fast
eliminating the prejudice against use of supplies from cold
storage plants of reputable houses.</p>

<p>The first cold-storage house was cooled by the use of
a mixture of crushed ice and salt. The modern process
is the ammonia brine method. As the liquid ammonia
enters the pipes that carry the refrigeration through the
cooler, it expands and is forced through the pipes as an
ammonia gas. An absorption method is also frequently
in use. Ammonia brine is by far the best method of cooling.
It is cleanly, absolutely odorless and, through use,
has proved its efficiency.</p>

<p>The establishment of scientific refrigeration plants has
made possible a variety and abundance of food at any
season on the American table.</p>

<p>Coolers are kept at an average temperature of 38° F.
for foods kept a short time. The temperature of the freezer
is normally ten above zero to ten below. Fresh meats are
not allowed to stay in the coolers longer than one to two
weeks. If they must be held longer, they are sent to the
freezer. When meat is to be thawed, it is taken from the
freezer and sent to the coolers. Once taken from the
freezer and defrosted, neither meat nor any other food
should ever go back. There are time limiting cold-storage
laws in twenty states. Twelve months is the limit of time
allowed in nineteen states.</p>


<div class="sidenote">BUTTER AND
EGGS</div>

<p>Butter in cold storage is kept at a temperature
of zero to five below. Its
sweetness and delicate flavor is the
same when taken from storage as when put in.</p>

<p>Eggs that are absolutely fresh and in perfect condition
when placed in cold storage, will keep perfectly at a
temperature between 29° F. and 31° F. for six to nine
months. Eggs laid in April and May are kept for midwinter
use, and the June pack is used in autumn and early
winter when the supply is scarce and prices high.</p>


<div class="sidenote">POULTRY</div>

<p>The box of frozen poultry your dealer displays
fresh from cold storage is most attractive
and appetizing. A Nationally known name on the
box guarantees the quality. Such poultry was especially
selected and carefully fed some time before killing. It is
fine-flavored and dainty. Always buy your frozen poultry
in the frozen state and thaw it out at home. Directions for
thawing are on <a href="#Page_13">page 13</a>.</p>

<h2 class="faux">GREAT VARIETY OF MEAT CUTS</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 615px;">
<img src="images/i-012.jpg" width="615" height="72" alt="GREAT VARIETY OF MEAT CUTS" />
</div>

<p>The great importance of meat as food lies in its high
protein content. Protein is body building material. It
forms one-fifth of our food requirements. Half of the protein
requirement is furnished by meat. In lean meat the
solid protein is very nearly in the pure form.</p>

<p>Meat is delicately constructed with small cells of tissue
holding the flavory juices. These cells are held together
by a connective tissue. In the cheaper cuts of meat, the
cells or fibers holding the juices are long and the connective
tissue thick. In the structure of the expensive steaks
and loin cuts, the cells are short and the connective tissue
thin. It is this difference in structure that makes it necessary
to use entirely different methods of cooking for the
tender cuts and for the cheaper ones. The same result—a
tender, flavory, nutritious cut of meat—may be obtained
with the cheaper cut as with the expensive loin cuts, if the
proper method of cooking is employed.</p>


<div class="sidenote">EQUALIZING
YOUR MEAT
BUYING</div>

<p>One so often hears the remark, “I wish
someone would invent a new animal.”
The housewife is tired of ordering beef,
mutton, pork or veal day after day. Too
often she orders only the roasts, steaks or chops from these
typical animals and then complains because her meat bill
is high. This idea of lack of variety in fresh meats is all because
of the unsound and uninteresting habit of buying the
same cuts over and over again.</p>

<p>For every loin of beef there are several other cuts
besides the extra portions, such as heart, liver, kidney,
brain, etc. In these lie possibilities for many distinctive
dishes and interesting flavors.</p>

<p>While there are not so many cuts of pork and lamb,
there are great possibilities for variety in the preparation.</p>

<p>Nine out of ten home managers have believed for
years, as do some even now, that the more expensive and
most tender cuts of meat must naturally be most nutritious
and that the cheaper, long fibered cuts are to be discarded
or left for the butcher to dispose of, not realizing that their
purchase of the tender cuts only, forces prices of these cuts
high enough to cover the cost of the carcass. We are
grateful that our leading dietitians of today are teaching
women the truth: that the cheaper cuts of meat are exactly
as nutritious as the tenderer cuts, if not more so, because
the blood is drawn to the parts in which the muscles
are constantly used, thus continually rebuilding the tissue.</p>

<p>In a dressed beef carcass of 700 pounds there are
about 200 pounds of prime meat. The loin of the hind
quarter, composed of sirloin, porterhouse, and club steaks,
and the prime ribs of the fore quarter, are the commercial
cuts most tender and easily prepared, and so are most in
demand. Your butcher orders the cuts you demand. If
you neglect the cheaper cuts and extra meat portions,
he will not order them, and the expense of their production
will be distributed over the cuts in demand.</p>

<p>An economically sound buying campaign would be a resolution
by the housewives to use in its regular order every
cut on a side of meat before reordering a cut. One of the
extra meat portions could well be every third meat purchase.</p>

<p>In order to secure the most satisfactory cuts of meat,
marketing should be done in person. Before this can be
done with any degree of satisfaction, the buyer should be
familiar with the various cuts of beef, pork and mutton.</p>

<p>The meal is planned around the meat dish, as a rule;
so it is most important to select the main meat dish with
greatest care.</p>


<div class="sidenote">HOW
TO SELECT
MEAT</div>

<p>When buying beef, see that it is bright red
in color, streaked with fat—and firm. The
streaks of fat add to the food value and
make a more flavory steak or roast. Veal
is pink in color, but less firm. Mutton flesh is firm and
dull red in color, the fat hard and white or slightly yellow.
Pork is dark pink in color and the fat is less firm than
beef or mutton.</p>


<div class="sidenote">SUPPLYING YOUR
DEALER WITH
FRESH MEAT</div>

<p>The modern system of refrigeration
has made world-wide distribution of
fresh meat possible. Refrigerator
cars, iced en route in such a manner
that the contents are kept always in a current of cold
air, make it possible to carry the products of the packing
house to remote parts of the country and deliver them in
sound condition.</p>

<p>The housewife in turn may have such products by being
discriminating in her marketing, skillful in her cooking
and careful in her serving.</p>

<p>By a knowledge of all the cuts of meat, the housewife
can keep down her meat expenditures. She should also
have her recipe file well stocked with tested recipes for the
wide variety of popular meat dishes to be made with the
less expensive cuts.</p>

<p>For those who do not include meat in their diet, there
is a wide variety of non-meat protein foods to choose from.
Eggs, cheese, milk, and beans will give the necessary protein
for a complete diet.</p>

<img src="images/i-013.jpg" width="622" height="71" alt="BEEF THE FAVORITE MEAT" />
</div>

<p>Much of the vigor and force of Americans is attributed to the beef which is so generously included in the American diet.
It is the favorite meat of a large percentage of people of every nation because it is easy to secure, is delicious of flavor
and, properly cooked, is easily assimilated. The best cuts of beef for broiling are porterhouse, sirloin, and tenderloin
steaks. For roasting, the prime ribs are preferred, while for the pot roast the rump, round, chuck, shoulder clod and
brisket result in a tender piece of meat of delicious flavor when subject to slow, moist cooking.</p>

<h2 class="faux">POULTRY</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 611px;">
<img src="images/i-014.jpg" width="611" height="91" alt="POULTRY" />
</div>

<p>Poultry is one of the most popular meats found upon
the American table. Dry-picked poultry is the most sanitary
and desirable. It is no simple matter to provide
fresh poultry to
our thickly populated
cities.
But with improved breeding, scientific feeding and the
modern cold-storage houses and refrigerator cars, Armour
and Company supply a large clientele with either fresh or
cold-storage poultry of the highest quality. “Spring chickens,”
so called because before the days of storage they could
be obtained only in the spring—are from three to six
months old. The older members of the chicken family are
known as “fowl.”</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 409px;">
<img src="images/i-015.jpg" width="409" height="215" alt="chicken" />
<div class="caption">Roast
Fowl</div>
</div>


<div class="sidenote">HOW TO SELECT</div>

<p>A chicken’s feet are soft and smooth
and the end of the breastbone is
flexible. Poultry that is to be carried over from the season of
plenty is carefully selected and specially fed and prepared.
Only the choicest corn and milk fed poultry is worthy of
the skill and science displayed in modern cold storage.
Scientific methods of packing fresh poultry, and shipment
in the refrigerator cars originated by the packers, assures
the most select fresh poultry in season. The undrawn
poultry is preferred to the drawn poultry in the market.</p>

<p>To thaw frozen poultry, submerge it in a pan of cold
water and leave in the water until thawed—about four
hours for a four-pound hen. Cook as soon as thawed.</p>

<p>To “draw,” it is only necessary to make an incision
below the breastbone just large enough to insert the hand
and remove the entire viscera at once.
Separate the giblets, remove the gall
bladder without breaking it, and clean
the gizzard by cutting through the flesh
and removing the inside sack intact; peel
the fleshy part off the sack. Insert two
fingers under the skin of the breast and
draw out and discard crop and windpipe.
Wash the inside of the bird by allowing
clean cold water to run through it. Wipe
inside and out. From this point the
chicken is treated according to the method to be used
in cooking. If it is to be “fried,” it is split in half lengthwise,
if very young, or in smaller pieces if it is a fowl.
For a roast, the chicken is left whole; for stewing, the fowl
is entirely disjointed.</p>

<h3>LAMB</h3>

<p>Lamb and mutton afford welcome meat dishes. Lamb
is most easily digested and very nutritious.</p>

<p>From a standpoint of economics, the increased use of
lamb and mutton results in greater production of wool.</p>

<p>In the menu, lamb and mutton should hold a permanent
place because of the number of attractive and wholesome
dishes they afford. The crown roast of lamb is a
decorative and delicious dish. The leg of lamb and shoulder
roll are just of the right size to be convenient for the average
family. With a sauce of tart jelly accompanying, they
make an excellent special or company dinner dish. There
are the loin chops; “French” and “American” rib chops,
delicious morsels when broiled; the shoulder, which may be
made into a mock duck that would deceive the most observant;
the neck and other cuts, which make delicious stews,
ragouts and broth. Twice a week is not too often to have
lamb in the menu.</p>

<h3>PORK</h3>

<p>The story of pork in the menu takes us back to the
days when the Chinese people discovered the goodness of
roast pork when the house burned and accidentally resulted
in the first “burnt pig.” Every house in the village was
soon in ashes to supply every inhabitant with the delicacy,
and its popularity has steadily increased.</p>

<p>Like all meat, pork is classed among the protein foods
and builds body tissue. Because of its high percentage of
fat, it also supplies heat and energy to the body.</p>

<p>The U. S. Government Inspection stamp guarantees
the wholesomeness of the pork you buy.</p>

<p>The digestibility of pork depends largely upon proper
cooking—it should be thoroughly cooked in a slow oven.
Smoked pork, in the form of ham and bacon, is very easily
digested, this being due to the curing and smoking.</p>

<p>In planning the menu including pork, include vegetables
containing considerable water, such as cabbage or
greens, and tart fruit and spicy dessert. Such a combination
will complete a meal rich in food value and satisfying
to the appetite.</p>

<h2 class="faux">HAM AND BACON</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 616px;">

</div>

<p>Ham and bacon are two of the
most popular foods in the American
market. These tasty staple foods
serve a double purpose. While they are perhaps the most
satisfactory stimulators of a dull appetite, they are such
hearty foods that in proper combination they easily satisfy
the most ravenous appetite.</p>

<p>Hams smoked in the stockinet covering retain their
shape and keep moist and juicy to the last slice. The
covering should be left on the raw ham and folded or
tied over the cut surface so the ham will retain all the
delicate nut flavor given by our special cure and expert
handling.</p>

<p>The ideal ham is firm, moist, juicy, tender and of medium
weight, not too fat or too lean. The stockinet covering
keeps the selected ham moist and firm.</p>

<p>Ham in some form is a welcome part of either breakfast,
luncheon or dinner several days every week.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 434px;">

</div>

<p>Bacon should be fine and firm—it is selected to suit
varying tastes and may be purchased with either the fat
or lean predominating or evenly distributed. Through
the smoking process certain
changes take place in meats
which render them more
easily digested, hence
bacon is one of the
most easily digested
and savory forms of fat. As sources of heat and energy,
bacon and ham rank high.</p>

<p>Even for a small family, it is wise to buy a whole ham.
This kind of quantity buying is economical and the many
ways to serve ham add variety to your menus. In planning
the use of the whole ham, first use the slices for
broiling, baked slice of ham, creamed ham and other dishes
requiring slices or cubes of ham. Use the last half of the
ham for baking in the piece.</p>

<p>Bacon in the piece or cartons
of bacon should be kept on hand
at all times. A breakfast of bacon
and eggs is the accepted breakfast and may be quickly and
easily prepared. A few strips of bacon add just the right
flavor to the roast fowl, meat loaf, larded tenderloin, or
casserole of vegetables or cereals.</p>

<p>The drippings from ham and bacon should be kept in
a cold place and used for shortening in spice cakes and
cookies, for flavor in sauces for vegetables and meats, for
sautéing where the smoked meat flavor is desirable, in the
dressing for vegetable salads, and in the stuffing for fowl.</p>

<h2 class="faux">MILK THE COMPLETE FOOD</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 615px;">
<img src="images/i-021.jpg" width="615" height="69" alt="MILK THE COMPLETE FOOD" />
</div>

<p>Milk is nature’s own food. It contains all the food
elements necessary for body growth, protein, mineral salts,
carbohydrates, fats, vitamines and water. It is the indispensable
food for the young. It lends itself to a great
variety of uses in the correct diet of the individual. Modern
housekeeping demands that a supply of a quality brand
of canned milk be in every pantry.</p>

<p>As an addition to coffee or tea, evaporated milk has
long been a recognized boon. Now, however, the convenience
of this as a pantry staple for the country, town or
city home cannot be overestimated. It is ever ready for
the milk or cream call necessary to the completion of a
perfect festive meal, or the easily digested milk toast or
eggnog for the convalescent as well as the everyday baking
need.</p>

<p>According to latest scientific experiments, the growth
properties known as vitamines, so rich in milk, are in no
way affected by the process of water elimination used to
produce evaporated milk.</p>

<p>Evaporated milk is a product of the greatest importance
to all families far removed from the source of a reliable
fresh milk supply. It is just the pure milk with a
large part of the moisture removed. It contains all the
natural butter fats, mineral salts, proteins, and solids of the
fresh milk. Nothing is changed in evaporated milk excepting
the quantity of water in the fluid. For that reason, when
canned milk is used to feed to children it is best to purchase
a reliable brand of evaporated milk. Condensed milk is
whole milk reduced by heating; it differs from evaporated
milk in that it has 40% to 44% sugar added.</p>

<p>A high quality evaporated milk contains 26.16% solids
and 69.24% water. A test of the keeping qualities of this
product demonstrated that evaporated milk would keep
sweet ten days after the can was opened. On souring
it may be used the same as soured whole milk and with
equally good results.</p>

<p>To use evaporated milk as whole milk, it should be
diluted in the proportion of one cup of evaporated milk to
two and one-quarter cups of water. This will give a product
averaging a rich whole milk.</p>


<div class="sidenote">VARIETY
OF USES</div>

<p>Evaporated milk is most satisfactory for
cream soups; for sauces for vegetables, fish
and meats. Whipped for puddings (undiluted).
Used diluted, it gives splendid results in cakes, muffins,
biscuits and other flour mixtures. As cream for coffee,
cocoa and chocolate, cereals, fruits and puddings it adds
food value and flavor. As a beverage diluted with water
or for eggnog it is just as satisfactory as ordinary milk for
children. For ice creams and custards, cream candies and
fudge it adds a smoothness and creaminess.</p>

</div>
<p>&nbsp;<br /></p>
<div class="sidenote">CHEESE</div>

<p>Cheese has an important mission in the dietary;
served as an accompaniment, it adds food
value, flavor and distinction. In large quantities it may
take the place in food value of the meat dish. It must, of
course, be served in combination with vegetables or cereal
food to supply the proper bulk.</p>

<p>Cheese contains protein and fat. It builds tissue and
creates heat and energy. For variety it may occasionally
be served as the main food for a meal—and adds zest when
used in salads and other table specialties.</p>

<p>In fuel value, one pound of cheese is equal to three and
one-third pounds of baked beans—or three quarts of whole
milk, twenty-five average size eggs, or of peanut butter
approximately three-fourths pounds.</p>

<p>Popular cheese dishes are Spaghetti and Cheese, Macaroni
and Cheese, Cauliflower and Cheese au Gratin, Potatoes
au Gratin, Melted Cheese Sandwiches, Cheese Crackers,
Eggs au Gratin, Cheese Croquettes, etc.</p>


<div class="sidenote">PEANUT BUTTER</div>

<p>Peanut Butter is a highly concentrated,
rich food, containing protein,
carbohydrates and fat, all in large proportion. For this
reason it may be used as a main dish in the menu in
proper combination. Peanut loaf, peanut soufflé, peanut
omelet, and peanut salad are fitting main dishes for the
dinner or luncheon.</p>

<p>In order to properly balance in the diet, peanut butter
must be combined with foods of more bulk and less food
value. Salad dressing and peanut butter make excellent
sandwiches. Combined with tomato pulp and milk, peanut
butter forms delicious soup. It may be used to flavor and
to shorten cookies and drop cakes. It also adds to custards
or salads. Due to its popular flavor, it also lends itself for
use in the making of delicious confections.</p>


<div class="sidenote">BEANS</div>

<p>Beans are in the class with meat and cheese as
protein food and may alternate with them as the
main dish in the menu. They offer a variety to the menu
served as bean loaf, soufflé, croquettes, relish, salad, or as
purée.</p>

<p>The choicest commercially prepared pork and beans
are made from selected double hand-picked Michigan pea
beans with carefully selected government-inspected pork.
They are cooked by the Appert Dry Steam Process, thereby
blending and retaining all the delicious bean flavor.</p>

<p>This dry steam process renders the beans more easily
digestible than is possible for home-cooked beans.</p>


<div class="sidenote">EGGS</div>

<p>Eggs contain all of the elements necessary to
life. Next to milk, selected eggs are the most
economical source of animal protein and, like milk, contain
the growth elements popularly known as fat soluble
A. Vitamines.</p>

<p>The highly concentrated food value of eggs makes it
necessary to combine them with such starchy foods as bread
or potatoes so that there will be sufficient bulk food for
the stomach to act upon. Eggs are an excellent substitute
for meat and are as indispensable as sugar in cooking.
It is necessary to cook eggs slowly and at a low temperature
to have them easily digested.</p>

<img src="images/i-024.jpg" width="617" height="74" alt="THE TASTY SAUSAGE" />
</div>

<p>Delicately seasoned sausage, made of carefully selected
Government-inspected meats, has a very definite place as a
staple food. Sausage is all food, no waste, and most appetizing.
The correctly blended seasonings of high-grade
sausage, fresh, smoked or dry, start the gastric juices and
act as an aid to digestion.</p>


<h3>FRESH PORK SAUSAGE</h3>

<p>Fresh pork sausage is very high in fuel value, the
fat adding to the protein, heat and energy-producing
material. This makes it essentially
a cold-weather food. The drippings should
always be saved to use as a sautéing medium
or shortening.</p>


<div class="sidenote">
HOW TO
SERVE</div>

<p>Fresh sausage, either links or bulk. Fry and
serve with toast, pancakes or muffins, mashed
potatoes, rice or hominy, for breakfast, dinner
or luncheon. Stuff potatoes and apples with fresh pork
sausage, bake and serve as a nutritive luncheon novelty.</p>

<p>Tart fruit always adds to the meal of which fresh pork
sausage is the main dish.</p>


<h3>SMOKED SAUSAGE</h3>

<p>Bologna and Frankfurters have gained wide reputation
as dependable meats satisfactory for all informal occasions.
They are made of pork, beef, and mutton. They are carefully
spiced with delicate mild spices.</p>


<div class="sidenote">SUGGESTIONS
FOR SERVING</div>

<p>Smoked sausage may be used for any
meal. The Bologna is preferable for
luncheon dishes and picnics; the Frankfurters
for any hot meal.</p>

<h3>DRY SAUSAGE</h3>

<p>As dry sausage is a product which originated across
the water, American housewives are rapidly learning to
appreciate its higher food value. Fresh U. S. Gov’t inspected
meat cuts are selected and combined with the
choicest seasonings and subjected to unique curing processes,
making this a most delicious food ready to eat. There is
a wide variety to suit every taste. Recipes from Italy,
France and the other foreign countries are followed or improved
upon to make American dry sausage the superior
food it is.</p>

<p>Dry sausage may be made into a great variety of appetizing
dishes or served sliced, cold. It is wholesome and
nutritious. An attractively garnished platter of Dry Sausage
is a favorite for a cold meal.</p>


<div class="sidenote">HOW TO
SERVE</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Breakfast</span>: Creamed dry sausage with
apple-fritters; diced and cooked in pancakes;

<h2 class="faux">READY TO SERVE MEATS</h2>

<img src="images/i-027.jpg" width="623" height="71" alt="READY TO SERVE MEATS" />
</div>

<p>As the many advantages of ready-cooked canned meats
have become more generally known, their universal use
has constantly increased, so that to-day thousands of housewives
maintain on their pantry shelves a variety of canned
meats to supply all regular and emergency requirements.</p>

<p>Meat was first put up in cans to prolong its keeping
qualities, especially during the hot weather season. So uniformly
successful were these experiments that the original
purpose has been almost forgotten, and canned meat now
occupies an all-year-round prominent place in the national
food supply.</p>

<p>When canned meats are sold under a nationally known
brand name, such as Armour’s Veribest, you can be sure
that the meats are carefully selected, U. S. Government inspected,
and prepared, cooked and seasoned in sanitary, scrupulously
clean kitchens by the most expert chefs. Complete
sterilization, accompanied by a vacuum process of sealing,
guarantees their perfect keeping qualities and enables the
home manager to serve this meat on her table with all the deliciousness
of meat prepared by the nation’s most expert cooks.</p>

<p>The cost per pound is a trifle higher than fresh meat,
but it is already cooked, there is no shrinkage, it is 100%
edible, and therefore can be served on the table at a relatively
lower cost. Canned Meats served either hot or cold
can be prepared in as many appetizing ways as fresh meat.</p>

<p>The housewife should always buy canned meats by
brand name; for the label, plus the U. S. Government Inspection
stamp, is the safest buying guide that can be found.</p>

<p>In every home where meals are served regularly it is a
great convenience to have on the pantry shelf a complete
supply of canned meats, for it takes the guesswork out of
cookery, saves time and labor, and assures the home
manager of a successful meat dish for any regular or emergency
meal.</p>

<p>Any first-class dealer can supply you with a complete
variety of high quality canned meats.</p>

<p>Always read the label when buying and be sure to
look for the U. S. Government inspected and passed legend
on every can of meat you buy.</p>


<h3>MEAT LOAF</h3>

<p>Meat loaf is made from choice selected Government
Inspected meats. Prepared commercially by chefs who
daily use the same accurate measurements of beef and
pork trimmings combined with macaroni, eggs, cheese and
seasonings. The results are standard products. When
whole, the loaves average about six pounds in weight.</p>

<p>Meat loaves are widely popular, time and energy savers
for the housewife and may be purchased in any amount
desired, from your butcher, grocer or delicatessen.</p>


<h4>VARIETY OF LOAF GOODS</h4>


<ul class="smallin small">
<li>Special Loaf—Selected beef and pork, macaroni, eggs, cheese and seasonings.</li>
<li>Meat Loaf—Selected beef and pork, bread crumbs, eggs and seasonings.</li>
<li>Veal Loaf—Selected veal and pork, cracker meal and seasonings.</li>
</ul>


<p>In more elaborate form are jellied loaves. Such meats
as tongue, tripe, pigs’ feet, corned brisket of beef and ox
lips are selected, cooked whole, covered with gelatine and
molded into loaf form. They require no home preparation,
are ready to slice and serve.</p>

<h3>LUNCHEON MEATS</h3>

<p>Luncheon meats are made of selected pork trimmings
cut in somewhat larger portions than for the loaf meats.
These meats, carefully seasoned, mixed and cooked, suggest
a great variety of dishes.</p>

<p>As an appetizer, sandwich fillers, sliced cold on lettuce
or in salad, luncheon meats have come into great favor.</p>

<h3>EXTRACT OF BEEF</h3>

<p>Extract of Beef adds the distinctive touch to many
meat and fish sauces, soups and gravies. It is a valued
meat extender as it adds the meat flavor necessary to
make a small amount of meat, flavor a large amount
of cereal in a loaf or croquettes. Many salads and vegetable
dishes are greatly improved by the addition of a bit
of Extract of Beef to the sauce.</p>

</div>

<p>A properly balanced diet
contains a regular supply of
fat. The ideal diet determined
by weight, height,
occupation and general
health of the individual
contains just sufficient
quantity of fat and carbohydrates
to give the required
amount of heat and energy.
In popular terms, one-fifth of the diet should consist of fat.
Much of this may be fat of vegetables or meats, but some
of it should be butter fat or its equivalent, especially for
children because of the vitamines it contains. Scientists
agree that oleo oil also contains the growth-promoting
elements.</p>

<p>The necessity of fat in the diet has been proven by
numerous experiments. Animals lacking certain fats do
not grow and cannot reproduce. Disastrous results have
attended nations where shortage of supplies made it impossible
to include the necessary fat in the diet.</p>

<p>Fats supply a large part of the heat and energy required,
an ounce giving two and one-half times as much
heat and energy as an ounce of carbohydrates. Butter,
oleomargarine, nut margarines, pure leaf lard, bacon, salt
pork, the fats of beef, mutton, pork and fowl, vegetable
fats and oils and peanut butter are our principal sources
of fat. A certain percentage is found in all nuts, cereals
and vegetables. For the average healthy person fats are
not difficult to digest if not taken in too large quantities
and if the fat is properly used in the food.</p>


<h3>SPREADS</h3>

<p>Butter, oleomargarine, nut margarine and
peanut butter are the spreads in general use.
In a well balanced diet these may be
used interchangeably. The food value is
principally in the heat and energy
furnished, which is practically equal
in all the spreads. Butter and highest
grade oleomargarine contain
certain growth elements not found
in the nut butter, but milk or the
average well varied diet corrects this.</p>

<p>Butter is one of the best sources
of fat for the daily diet. High grade creamery
butter, such as Cloverbloom, is made in the heart of the rich
dairy districts, from sweet pasteurized cream.</p>

<p>Oleomargarine has a well recognized place among
spreads, due to a growing understanding among intelligent
housewives as to its composition and the ideal conditions
under which it is made. It is made by churning pure, sweet
animal oils and vegetable oils in pasteurized milk and
salting to taste. Since the housewife knows that materials
used in oleomargarine are used daily in one form or another
in her home and that it is given Government Inspection,
oleomargarine has become a most generally used spread.</p>

<p>The vegetable or nut margarines are made from pure
cocoanut and peanut oils churned in pasteurized milk.
They are daily growing in public favor. The low moisture
content of nut margarine and the care in preparation
make it a rich and tasty spread. Nut-ola is the popular
Armour nut margarine.</p>

<p>Peanut butter, although used as a spread, has become
universally known as one of our most excellent protein
sources to replace meat. Easily digested, it is not only
popular with adults, but a good food for children.</p>


<div class="footer">There is an Armour Oval Label Product for every need of fat in the diet or in cookery</div>


<h3>THE PROPER FAT FOR EVERY COOKERY USE</h3>

<p>For shortening purposes, fats are used to improve the
texture of the product. The fat in the mixture protects the
starch grains from the moisture until the proper time in
baking, allowing the leavening agent to act and the starch
grains to swell, resulting in a light even-textured product.</p>

<div class="caption">Delicious, Nutritious Doughnuts</div>
</div>

<p>It is possible to use a
great variety of fats for
cooking. Animal fats
have been popular shortenings.
Recent
fat
shortage
has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
acquainted us with the value of vegetable fats as shortening
and in spreads. Armour’s vegetable fat is Vegetole. It
contains the same fuel value and has the same shortening
value as lard. Pure Leaf Lard or vegetable fats are the
ideal shortenings. Salad Oil, highly refined vegetable fat,
Oleomargarine, Nut-ola, butter, and drippings from bacon,
ham, beef and pork are used with entire satisfaction for
shortening purposes.</p>

<p>The fats best suited to deep frying and sautéing are
those which have a very high burning point. For general
“all purpose” satisfaction, pure leaf lard ranks first. There
is an Armour product especially suited to every cookery
need.</p>


<h3>FATS</h3>

<p>Bacon drippings may be substituted for lard in frying,
baking, or in gravies, providing the drippings are clarified
and not too strong. A great many people prefer the flavor
of bacon drippings to any other shortening.</p>

<p>Beef suet drippings, for reheating meats or for frying
or shortening purposes, take the place of lard and are much
more economical.</p>

<p>Pork fat, left from roast, chops or ham, can be used in
the same manner.</p>

<p>Mutton drippings need no longer be set aside, since
the housewife has learned how to sweeten them.</p>

<p>Smoky kitchens indicate the improper use of fat in
cooking. Too high a temperature causes a chemical change
to take place which results in smoke and disagreeable odor,
and also renders the fat less digestible.</p>

<p>Put cold fat into a cold pan before placing it over the
heat. Bringing into contact with the hot pan frequently
results in burning the fat.</p>

<p>For deep frying and sautéing, care should be taken not
to heat the fat to too high a temperature, as burning decomposes
the fat and renders it less digestible. In deep
fat frying, place the food to be fried in the hot fat a small
amount at a time. The addition of the cold food reduces
the temperature of the fat.</p>

<p>Do not pile fried articles. Drain on unglazed paper.</p>

<p>Strain fat after using, save, and use again.</p>

<p>When fat is not hot enough, when mixture
is too rich, when mixture is too moist, and
when too much soda or baking powder has
been used, deep-fried foods will take up too much fat and
be greasy.</p>


<div class="sidenote">TEST FOR
TEMPERATURE</div>

<p>A piece of soft bread will brown in 40
seconds in deep fat that is just hot
enough for cooked articles, or in 60
seconds in fat at the right temperature for uncooked foods.</p>

<p>Fat is too hot if it smokes.</p>


<div class="sidenote">TO CLARIFY
FAT</div>

<p>To clarify the frying medium for second
or third use, melt, add raw potato cut in
quarter inch slices, and allow to heat
gradually; when it ceases to bubble and the potatoes are
well browned, strain through double cheesecloth, placed
over the wire strainer into a pan.</p>


<h3>SALAD OIL USED IN COOKING</h3>

<p>Vegetable salad oil meets all the requirements for a
rich, delicately flavored oil for salad dressing. Highly refined
cottonseed oil and cocoanut oil are American products,
made from highly refined vegetable oil. Both have proved
entirely satisfactory and economical as salad oil. Highly
refined cottonseed oil for frying has a high smoking point,
and, properly used, gives off no unpleasant odor.</p>

<h2 class="faux">FRUITS TO COMPLETE THE MEAL</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 612px;">
<img src="images/i-031.jpg" width="612" height="89" alt="FRUITS TO COMPLETE THE MEAL" />
</div>


<p>The dietetic value of fruits
lies in the fruit sugar, mineral
salts, and organic acids which
they contain. Fruits are body regulators.</p>

<p>Fruit sugar or carbohydrates are the chief sources of
fuel value in fruit. Most fruits also contain the substance
which is necessary for jelly making. A fruit which does
not contain pectin, such as pears and pineapple, must be
combined with some fruit containing pectin. Apples,
grapes, and currants contain great quantities of pectin.</p>

<p>Fresh fruit eaten the first thing in the morning acts as
a cleanser. Care must be taken in the selection of fruit,
it should be ripe, but not overripe. If overripe, it is liable
to cause fermentation in the alimentary tract.</p>

<p>Science has perfected the drying process to such a
degree that dried fruit has become a great convenience
when the fresh product is not obtainable.</p>

<p>Because it is impossible to wholly consume all fruits
at the harvesting time, great quantities are canned for
later consumption. To retain the highest natural flavor
and full fruit sugar value, it is necessary to can fruits and
vegetables just as they ripen and immediately after picking.
Commercial canning of fruits has reached such a high degree
of excellence that the average home manager prefers
to buy a reliable brand she knows to be uniform, rather
than run the risk of having fruits spoil that she uses her
own time and material to “put up.”</p>

<p>The wide variety of fruits on the market under reliable
brand names makes it possible to serve practically any
fruit at any season. Even the special types of fruits may
be purchased canned, as Royal Anne Cherries, Muscat
Grapes, Bartlett Pears, Egg Plums, etc.</p>

</table></div>


<p>All fruits combine in fruit salads, cocktails, ices.</p>


<h3>VEGETABLES</h3>

<p>Vegetables contain a large amount of water, cellulose,
and mineral matter. They are included under the classification
of carbohydrates, or mineral salts according to the
predominance of starch or mineral matter. Leafy vegetables
are rich in vitamines.</p>

<p>The mineral salts afford
bone building material, while
the large amount of cellulose
which they contain furnishes bulk in the diet.</p>

<p>Canned vegetables are preserved by sterilization. Salt
is used to bring out the flavor, acts as a preservative, and
increases the mineral content.</p>

<p>Dried vegetables are being used in soups and ragouts.
The dried vegetables have not yet reached as extensive
use as have the dried fruits.</p>

<p>Commercially canned vegetables add year round
variety to practically every American table. The selection
of a reliable brand simplifies the marketing.</p>


<h4>The Vegetables to Serve with Various Meats</h4>

<p>Tomatoes—Broiled Steak, Lamb Chops. Asparagus—Planked
Steak, Roast Beef, Lamb Chops, Veal Chops.
Spinach—Ham, Tongue, all meats, eggs, fish. Peas—Lamb
Chops, Chicken, Meat croquettes. String Beans—Ham,
Boiled Lamb, Chicken. Okra—Chicken, Tuna, Ham.
Celery—Cheese Dishes.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All vegetables combine in vegetable casseroles and salads.</p></div>


<div class="sidenote">MINCE
MEAT</div>

<p>Mince Meat nearly conforms to the requisites
of a perfect food. It contains protein from the
meat content, carbohydrates, both sugar and
starch in the form of fruits, and moisture. Spices and
flavoring make it complete. Its fuel value is considerable.
It should not merely be used as a holiday food, but as an
all year round product.</p>

<p>Mince meat contains only the best and most wholesome
ingredients. On the market are two varieties, the
condensed and moist. Moist mince meat requires more
attention because of its aptness to ferment. In making it,
green apples and fresh cider are used. As cider makes
vinegar and raisins and currants make wine, fermentation
is possible. This does not mean that the mince meat is no
longer good. The alcohol formed acts as a preservative.</p>

<p>Concentrated mince meat contains dried apples and
boiled cider. In this respect only does it differ from moist
mince meat. By the addition of water, the condensed
becomes equal to moist. Condensing is done merely to aid
in packing and delivery.</p>


<h3>VARIETY OF USES</h3>

<p>Pie Patties, Brown Bread and Mince Meat Sandwich,
Pudding, Tomato stuffed with Mince Meat, Mince Meat
Salad, Mince Meat Relish, Mince Meat Cookies.</p>

<h3>THE PANTRY STOCK</h3>

<p>Perhaps one of the greatest simple helps toward a well-ordered home is a well-stocked pantry. With this to rely
upon, one is always ready for any demand that can interfere with the regular plans of the household.</p>

<p>Besides a carefully selected assortment of quality foods already prepared, a number of menus and the recipes
to accompany them should be easily accessible, so that in case the home-manager herself is away from home or is ill,
almost any member of the family can keep the meals going satisfactorily.</p>

<p>The pantry shelf should contain CANNED soups, fish, meats, milk, vegetables, fruits; jams, jellies, condiments, a few
packages of cookies and crackers. A few cans of evaporated milk come in handy, even on the farm, now and
then, and will keep until needed.</p>

<p>Let the Armour Housewives’ Choosing List be your guide in stocking this shelf. When a package is used,
replace it at once so that the shelf will be ready for all staple and emergency calls, sure to come when least expected.
During the warm months, many of the foods illustrated on <a href="#Page_24">pages 24-25</a> will be kept in the refrigerator.</p>

<p>Cookery, to meet the present day standards, is necessarily
an art and a science. (<i>See <a href="#Page_46">page 46</a> for measures and abbreviations.</i>)</p>

<p>Skill in blending flavors, and arranging dishes to please the eye as well
as the palate, is an art of which every home manager may be proud. Still more important, however, is the scientific
preparation of nutritious and economical dishes to supply the body needs of every member of the family.</p>

<p>In these pages devoted to cookery we have covered important cookery points which influence the palatability,
digestibility, and combination of materials for best results. Our aim is to present to the American home manager a
valuable cooking manual, not a recipe book. Below are listed many splendid books of recipes in your public library:</p>

<h3>SOUPS</h3>

<p>Prepare soup stock in a kettle which will retain heat.
Fit with a tight cover, for the vapors must be held in to
add to the flavor of the stock. Shank and neck of beef,
pork or lamb, left-over morsels of meat, bones from steaks,
roasts, chops and the carcasses of poultry, are good materials
from which to make meat stock.</p>

<p>Crack and saw bones to uniform size, put into kettle
and add cold water in the proportion of three cups
of cold water to one pound of bones.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 368px;">
<img src="images/i-034.jpg" width="368" height="165" alt="bowl of soup" />
<div class="caption">Cream of
Tomato Soup</div>
</div>
<p>Let stand for one-half hour or until water is
colored by juices, heat to boiling point. Skim off
fat, reduce heat and let simmer or bubble slowly
for four hours. The stock must be kept at low
temperature in cooking so that the albumen or
jelly of the meat will not coagulate, but be retained
in the stock, giving it full flavor.</p>

<p>Cook until the meat is shredded and colorless.
When nearly done, add vegetables and seasoning.
Strain, set stock aside to cool—discard bones, reserving
vegetables and meat portions, which are
still rich in food value, for further use in pressed loaves.
A bit of Extract of Beef will add the desired meat flavor.</p>

<p>Stock is used as the foundation for all meat and vegetable
soups. Cream soups have white sauce as a foundation
with the vegetable purée added.</p>

<h2 class="faux">MEAT COOKERY</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 615px;">
<img src="images/i-035.jpg" width="615" height="93" alt="MEAT COOKERY" />
</div>



<p class="center">(<i>See <a href="#Page_7">pages 7</a>, <a href="#Page_8">8</a> and <a href="#Page_9">9</a> for Meat Charts</i>)</p>

<p>To be sure of success in meat cookery, know first the structure of the
cut of meat you are to prepare, then use a standard tested method for making
that cut tender, flavory and juicy.</p>

<p>Always have a good fire before placing meat over the heat, for all meat cookery requires the greatest heat first to
seal the appetizing juices in. Your skill will be shown in your first ten minutes of handling.</p>

<p>The short fibered cuts comprising the loin cuts, porterhouse, and club steaks may be given the entire short cooking
over a hot fire. Practically all the other cuts on the carcass require long moist cooking after the searing process.</p>

<p>All boiling pieces should be put into boiling water first and after ten minutes’ brisk boiling, the heat should be reduced
so that the meat simmers until the connective tissue softens and the meat is tender and just right for carving.
Too long brisk boiling makes the meat stringy. Roasts should be cooked on the same principle. Put into the hot oven
for fifteen minutes, then reduce the heat and cook the cut slowly, basting frequently. Steaks and chops that are to be
pan broiled, should be put on a hot pan and quickly turned so as to sear and brown evenly, then allowed to cook through,
over the hot fire. As salt draws the juices out of meats it should not be added until after the first ten or fifteen minutes
of cooking, when the meat is thoroughly seared.</p>


<h3>METHODS</h3>


<div class="sidenote">BROILING</div>

<p>This process of cooking subjects the meat,
fish or poultry to the direct rays of the fire,
quickly searing and browning the meat; this is the approved
method of cooking tender steaks and chops, fish and spring
chicken. An intense, even heat is necessary.</p>


<div class="sidenote">PAN BROILING</div>

<p>A very hot frying pan is used without
addition of any fat; chops and steaks
are cooked in this way.</p>


<div class="sidenote">ROASTING
AND BAKING</div>

<p>Roasting is oven cooking in an uncovered
pan. Baking differs only in the fact
that the pan is covered, thus making the
cooking self basting. Prime ribs, loin or leg, and fowl, are
roasted; rump, short ribs and shoulder are frequently baked.</p>


<div class="sidenote">POT
ROASTING</div>

<p>Wipe the meat, dredge with flour and brown
the entire surface in a little fat, place the
meat on a rack in a deep kettle and cover
with boiling water. Cook with vegetables and seasoning,
adding vegetables at intervals to allow for the perfect
cooking of each class of vegetables by the time the meat
is done. Place cover on kettle and simmer slowly about
four hours. Serve with the thickened liquor.</p>


<div class="sidenote">BOILING</div>

<p>Cooking in liquid at 212° F. is boiling. Meat
should never be boiled rapidly, as the fibers become
tough and the tissues dissolved. To have boiled meats
tasty and juicy, plunge the meat into boiling water and
cook for ten minutes, then lower the heat and cook slowly
until tender. An excellent way to cook shank, clod, shoulder
plate, brisket or neck. A fireless cooker is practical for
this type of cookery. A pressure cooker makes it possible
to cook a tough fowl or cut of meat in a very short time.</p>


<div class="sidenote">BRAISING</div>

<p>Cooking in a closely covered pan in the oven
is termed braising; a small amount of water
is used. The meat is usually sautéed first, to prevent escape
of much juice. Vegetables are often cooked with the
meat. The temperature should be kept low. It is an excellent
way for cooking spareribs, brisket, rump, shoulder
or chuck roast. Besides stewing or boiling, it is an excellent
way to prepare the tough cuts.</p>


<div class="sidenote">SAUTÉING</div>

<p>Pan frying in just enough fat to brown the
foods nicely and keep them from sticking
to the pan is called sautéing. Fish, steaks, chops and potatoes
are cooked by this method.</p>


<div class="sidenote">STEWING</div>

<p>Meat for a stew, such as neck, clod, shank,
brisket or chuck, can be cut in small pieces,
browned to hold in juices before cooking in the boiling
water; or, omitting that process, put directly in a small
amount of hot water and cooked at a low temperature for
a long time. All nutriment is retained in the meat.</p>


<div class="sidenote">DEEP FRYING</div>

<p>For this method of cooking, an iron
kettle is best. Half fill the kettle with
fat and place over fire; melt and, when a slight blue vapor
arises, test with a small cube of bread. If bread browns in
one minute, the temperature is right for uncooked mixtures
(doughnuts). If it browns in forty seconds, it is right for
cooked materials (croquettes). The temperature of the
fat should average 350-400 degrees F. Keep the temperature
even; if too cool, the food will soak fat; if too hot, both fat
and material to be cooked will burn. Foods cooked in deep
fat should be drained on brown paper.</p>

<h4>HUNGARIAN GOULASH</h4>

<div class="center">Serves 5. Preparation 2½ hours.</div>

<ul class="ingredients2">
<li>2 lbs. beef (shoulder clod)</li>
<li>Salt</li>
<li>Flour</li>
<li>¼ lb. fat salt pork</li>
<li>Boiling water</li>
<li>2 cups tomatoes</li>
<li>1 sliced onion</li>
<li>1 stalk celery</li>
<li>Bit of bay leaf</li>
<li>4 cloves</li>
<li>2 cups sliced potatoes</li>
<li>1½ cups carrots</li>
<li>1 green pepper</li>
<li>Parsley</li>
</ul>


<p>Wipe beef, cut in two-inch pieces, and roll in flour.
Cut salt pork in dice and fry until light brown. Add beef
and cook until meat is well browned, stirring constantly.
Add salt and enough boiling water to prevent burning, and
cook slowly two hours or until tender. In another dish
cook tomatoes, onion, chopped celery, bay leaf and cloves
for thirty minutes. Add two tbsp. flour, mixed until smooth
with two tbsp. cold water, and cook thoroughly. Add to
meat. Remove meat to center of platter, surround it
with potato slices and carrots cut in strips and cooked until
tender in boiling salted water, and add the green pepper
parboiled and cut in strips. Pour gravy over the meat;
garnish with parsley.</p>


<h3>STEAKS</h3>


<h4>BROILED SIRLOIN STEAK</h4>

<div class="center">Serves 6-7. Preparation 10 minutes.</div>


<ul class="ingredients2">
<li>3½ lbs. steak</li>
<li>½ tsp. salt</li>
<li>⅛ tsp. pepper</li>
<li>2 tbsp. butter</li>
</ul>


<p>Wipe meat with cloth wrung out of cold water. Remove
superfluous fat and use to grease the broiler. Have
broiler very hot. Place meat on broiler about three inches
from the heat, which should be even, whether it is coal,
gas or electricity. Turn meat every
ten seconds at first, that the surface
may be well seared and prevent
the escape of the juices.</p>

<p>Steak 1½ inches thick will require
10 minutes if desired rare, 12
to 15 minutes if preferred well done.</p>

<div class="caption">Grilled Sirloin Steak</div>
</div>

<h4>PLANKED RUMP STEAK</h4>

<div class="center">Serves 5-6. Preparation 25 minutes.</div>

<ul class="ingredients2">
<li>1 cross cut of rump steak (1¾ inches thick)</li>
<li>2 tbsp. butter</li>
<li>½ tsp. salt</li>
<li>2 c. small beets</li>
<li>⅛ tsp. pepper</li>
<li>6 slices tomato</li>
<li>6 slices lemon</li>
<li>6 stuffed olives</li>
<li>6 potatoes</li>
</ul>

<p>Wipe steak, remove superfluous fat, and pan broil seven
minutes. Grease an oak plank and arrange, close to the
edge, a border of mashed potatoes, pressed through a pastry
bag. Remove steak to plank, put into a hot oven, and
bake until steak is cooked and potatoes are browned.
Spread steak with butter, salt and pepper, and garnish with
parsley, lemon and olives. Arrange beets and other vegetables,
if desired, on the side.</p>


<h3>MEAT SAUCES AND GRAVY</h3>

<p>Use the meat juices left from cooked meat or fowl,
removing any excess fat. Extract of beef may be substituted
for meat juices in gravy.</p>

<p>After removing meat and excess fat from the roasting
pan or skillet, heat meat juices to boiling and thicken carefully.
To avoid lumpy gravy, the best way is to mix the
flour with a small amount of water, stirring until smooth,
then gradually adding more cold water until the thickening
is of the right consistency. Add gradually to the hot liquid,
stirring constantly.</p>

<p>Allow mixture to cook ten minutes. Gravy should be
cooked thoroughly to avoid any raw or starchy taste, too
common to American gravies.</p>

<p>Season carefully, according to the meats gravy is to be
served with. It is wise to taste before serving.</p>

<p>The distinctive touch French chefs are noted for in
their meat and fish dishes is often due to the sauce accompanying
them. Any careful American cook can acquire
the same reputation for skill by following the suggestions
to cook thoroughly and season distinctively.</p>

<h3>SELECTION OF YOUNG FOWL</h3>

<p>The flesh of young fowl is smooth. The claws and
feet are usually light yellow in color and are very supple.
A breastbone which bends easily indicates young fowl.
Fowl should be plump, but not over plump. If fowl is exceptionally
fat at the crop, it indicates large inner organs.
They weigh heavily, and therefore are poor purchases.</p>


<h3>PREPARATION FOR COOKERY</h3>

<p>Care should be taken that the fowl is drawn and
thoroughly cleansed. This is often attended to by the
local butcher, but special care and attention is also needed
in the home.</p>

<p>The pin feathers must all be removed and the fowl
singed. All blood clots, portions of lungs, etc., should be
removed. Hold fowl under faucet, and let water from
faucet rush through it to remove any clinging portions.</p>


<h3>TERMS USED IN SELECTING FOWL</h3>


<ul class="ingredients"><li>Chicken—Term applied to fowls under ten months.</li>
<li>Broilers—Young spring chickens about six months old.</li>
<li>Fowl—Term including chicken, turkey, goose and duck.</li>
<li>Pullet—Young hen. Term including fowl up to the age of one year.</li>
<li>Capon—Specially fattened male chicken.</li></ul>




<h3>METHODS OF COOKING</h3>


<div class="sidenote2">ROASTING</div>

<p>Chicken and turkey being dry meat, require
frequent bastings. The grease which accumulates
in the roasting of geese must be poured off
from time to time. This should be clarified and carefully
saved for use in pastries and as spreads. Strips of salt
pork or bacon if placed across turkey or chicken baste
the fowl as well as flavor it.</p>


<div class="sidenote2">STEWING</div>

<p>Older fowl is best when stewed. The fowl
should be put into boiling water, seasoning
added, and gently cooked at the simmering point for several
hours before the vegetables are added. Cook until the
meat is very tender. Add dumplings the last twenty
minutes.</p>


<div class="sidenote2">BROILING</div>

<p>Fowl that is to be broiled should be brushed
well with oil and allowed to stand in cool
place some time before broiling. Sprinkling with lemon
juice also tends to make it tender as well as flavors the fowl.
Strips of bacon laid across the top baste the fowl. Turn
frequently to insure thorough cooking.</p>


<div class="sidenote2">FRYING</div>

<p>Select young fowl for frying. Long, slow cooking
is needed to thoroughly cook the fowl. The
portions are dipped in egg and crumbs to protect them
from the high heat of the pan and so keep them tender.
Use a shallow griddle and add bacon fat as necessary.</p>


<div class="sidenote2">DRESSING
A FOWL</div>

<p>In order that the legs, wings, and neck of
fowl will not dry out, it is well to truss the
fowl for roasting.</p>

<p>Fold back the wings so that they form a “V” on the
back. Fold the neck back so that it fits beneath the wings.
Fasten with twine. Bend back legs and fasten them close
to the rump. Also fasten joints close to the body. If
dressing is to be used, stuff in body and then sew up the
openings. A trussing or darning needle threaded with
twine makes the matter of trussing quite simple.</p>


<div class="sidenote2">FROZEN
FOWL</div>

<p>If fowl is purchased frozen, thaw in pan of
cold water or place in refrigerator for six
hours and then dress in the usual manner.
Frozen fowl handled by a nationally recognized food organization
has been carefully selected and possesses a
delicate flavor.</p>


<div class="sidenote2">PRESSURE
COOKERY
OF FOWL</div>

<p>Fowl may be fried or stewed in the pressure
cooker. The foods are made ready as in
the ordinary method and are placed in the
bottom of the cooker. Vegetables or cereals
may be placed on the rack above and cooked at the
same time. The lid is then adjusted and the pressure
raised to about 18 pounds and then kept there for thirty
minutes. Fowl that is old is quickly cooked tender in a
pressure cooker.</p>


<h3>WAYS OF SERVING LEFT-OVER FOWL</h3>

<p>Fricassee, creamed chicken, chicken à la king, croquettes,
soufflé of fowl, timbales, en casserole, salad, pilaff,
patties, cold jellied loaf with vegetables, club sandwiches,
hot chicken sandwiches, fritters, dumplings, pot pie, cottagers’
pie, pan roast, boned stuffed chicken, soup, country
fried, pressed chicken, forcemeat, blanketed, curry, cutlets,
gumbo, scalloped, stew.</p>

<h2 class="faux">SALADS</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 611px;">
<img src="images/i-040.jpg" width="611" height="74" alt="SALADS" />
</div>



<p>Salads are combinations of meat, fish, eggs, vegetables,
or fruits and nuts with a dressing.</p>

<p>Mayonnaise should not be added to salad until just
before serving, as it may liquefy. It is most satisfactory
to mix each ingredient in a fruit or vegetable salad with the
dressing separately and combine at the last moment.</p>

<p>Green vegetables, such as lettuce, should not have
dressing added until just before serving.</p>

<p>The flavor of meat and fish salads is improved by marinating
in French dressing before combining with other
materials.</p>


<h3>CARE OF MATERIALS</h3>


<div class="sidenote">LETTUCE AND
OTHER SALAD
GREENS</div>

as brought from garden or market.
Wrap in a wet tea towel or in salad
bag and place on the ice or in cold
place to keep fresh.</p>

<p>To keep parsley or other garnishes fresh, place in a
fruit jar, sprinkle with cold water and cover tightly. The
greens will remain fresh as long as there is moisture in
the jar.</p>

<h3>EGGS</h3>

<p>Although hens’ eggs are more commonly in use, the
eggs of ducks, geese, guinea fowl and turkeys are all used
as food.</p>


<div class="sidenote">USES</div>

<p>The various uses of eggs in cooking may be listed
as follows:</p>


<ul class="ingredients"><li>1 As a substitute for meat</li>
<li>2 To clear soup and coffee</li>
<li>3 To thicken sauces, etc.</li>
<li>4 To make certain foods light, omelet, soufflés</li>
<li>5 As a garnish</li>
<li>6 To improve flavor</li>
<li>7 To color certain foods</li>
<li>8 To glaze breads, rolls, etc.</li>
<li>9 As a leavening agent in baking</li></ul>




<div class="sidenote">PRINCIPLES
OF COOKERY</div>

<p>In cooking eggs, heat produces a change
in both color and in firmness, the firmness,
or hardness, depending on the
temperature and length of time cooked. The change
which takes place in the egg albumen is called coagulation.
A high temperature for any continued length of
time will produce a leathery consistency, which necessitates
a longer time for digestion.</p>

<p>Soft-cooked eggs digest more quickly and more satisfactorily
than do eggs prepared any other way.</p>

<p>The margin is slight, however, and the stomach takes
care of all kinds of cooked eggs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOW TO
PRESERVE</div>

<p>As there is a harvest time for eggs, it is necessary
to insure eggs for year around use
by preserving a supply for winter release.</p>

<p>Preserve only fresh clean eggs in the spring and early
summer when they are cheap and plentiful. They may be
preserved in any of the following ways:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>1 Commercial cold storage is the most satisfactory method of preserving eggs.</p>

<p>2 Pack in sawdust, salt, bran or sand, with small end down.</p>

<p>3 Cover with salt brine, limewater or water glass.</p>

<p>4 Coat with lard, oil or paraffin.</p></div>


<h3>CHEESE</h3>


<div class="sidenote">PRINCIPLES
OF COOKERY</div>

<p>Cheese is sufficiently cooked when melted.
Protein is toughened by a high
temperature, therefore a low temperature
process should always be used in preparing cooked
cheese dishes.</p>

<p>Cheese should be kept dry and covered, but never
wholly exclude the air. If spread with melted paraffin,
it will keep moist. Soft cheese should be kept in the ice
box. The receptacle for cheese should be thoroughly sterilized
before new cheese is placed in it.</p>

<p>Cheese gives character to many nourishing but indistinct-flavored
foods.</p>

<p>Fresh vegetables should be whole and sound when
purchased. Roots and tubers require special care as to
cleanliness. Perishable vegetables should be used as soon
as purchased. If kept for any length of time, they should be
stored in a cool, dry place. From time to time, they
should be looked over and those which show signs of decay,
removed.</p>


<h3>PREPARATION FOR COOKING</h3>

<p>The first step is cleansing. Wash thoroughly in cold
water and then pick over or scrub with a vegetable brush to
thoroughly remove any small portions of dirt that may be
embedded in the outer covering or hidden among the leaves.
Remove all leaves, tops, etc. The ideal way, from a food
value standpoint, is to cook potatoes with the skins on, for,
if pared, the valuable mineral salts escape into the water.
Vegetables that are pared before cooking should be pared
very thin. Between the skin and outer layers of the vegetable
lies a layer containing much nutritive material, and,
unless the parings are thin, this material is lost. Water in
which pared vegetables are cooked should be saved and
used as soup stock.</p>


<h3>METHODS OF COOKING</h3>


<div class="sidenote">BOILING</div>

<p>Vegetables should be cooked in boiling water.
Strong smelling vegetables, such as cabbage,
onions, etc., will not give off strong odors if cooked in
plenty of water and uncovered. Other vegetables should
be cooked in just enough water to cover and the kettle
should be covered. Salt, however, toughens the fiber and,
for this reason, is only used in the cooking of young,
tender shoots. For the older vegetables the salt may be
added just before serving.</p>


<div class="sidenote">STEAMING</div>

<p>Steaming is a very satisfactory method of
cooking vegetables. The vegetables are
placed on racks in the steamer and cooked until tender.
None of the juices are lost, and the fiber is not toughened, and
the appearance and shape of the vegetables are preserved.</p>


<div class="sidenote">BAKING</div>

<p>Vegetables may be washed, and baked in a
moderate oven until the skin bursts. This
method of cooking is satisfactory in that no nutriment is
lost. The vegetables classed as roots, such as turnips,
parsnips, etc., may be baked, but are less suited to this
method of cooking.</p>


<h3>WAYS OF SERVING VEGETABLES</h3>


<ul class="ingredients">
<li>Fresh with dressing (salads)</li>

<h3>GARNISHES</h3>

<p>Garnishes of vegetables are often used to give a colorful
touch to meat dishes. A little sprig of parsley is often
sufficient decoration. Clever garnishes are made by means
of vegetable cutters. These are attractive additions when
used as a border around a meat dish.</p>

<p>Lettuce is used extensively as a garnish. It is used
most commonly as a garnish for cold meats.</p>

<h3>PROPORTION AND USE OF
MATERIALS</h3>

<p>Salt is used to bring out flavor.
Quantity used should be according to
amount of butter present. When nuts
are used, the amount of salt should be
increased slightly to bring out flavor.
When chocolate or cocoa is used, decrease
the amount of fat, as there is a
certain amount of fat in the cocoa and
chocolate.</p>

<h2 class="faux">PASTRIES</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 613px;">
<img src="images/i-046.jpg" width="613" height="69" alt="PASTRIES" />
</div>



<h3>PLAIN PASTRY</h3>

<p>In plain pastry the shortening is mixed into the flour by
chopping or with tips of fingers. All ingredients and utensils
should be cold. When the lard is thoroughly chilled a
large amount of ice-water can be incorporated, which, when
converted into steam, acts as a leavening agent and makes
the pastry light and fluffy.</p>


<h3>PUFF PASTE</h3>

<p>In puff paste the shortening is worked into a paste
of flour and water by folding and rolling. Equal parts by
weight of flour and shortening are used.</p>


<h3>MATERIALS</h3>

<p>Pure leaf lard is the ideal shortening for pastry making.
It makes a light colored, soft, tender crust. Pure
leaf lard is made only of leaf fat rendered in open kettles
by a special process which makes the resulting product
extremely rich and delicate.</p>

<p>Vegetole may be successfully used, following the same
methods as with lard. Vegetole is an absolutely pure vegetable
fat, processed to proper cooking consistency without
anything being added. It may be secured in a sanitary
pail in convenient size for home use.</p>

<p>Butter and oleomargarine are especially desirable for
puff paste. A fine pastry or cake flour will absorb moisture
least and is therefore one of the first requisites to pastry
making. A small quantity of baking powder insures lightness
to pie paste, but is not an essential to the product of
an expert.</p>


<div class="sidenote">RULES</div>

<p>Everything must be cold, handled lightly and
quickly and baked in a hot oven, to assure delicate
pastry. To prevent escape of juice, mix cornstarch or
flour with sugar and sprinkle lightly over the fruit before
covering with the top crust. Press the edges of the upper and
lower crusts tightly together. A cone of paper or piece of
macaroni may be put into the slit of the crust to allow the
escape of steam.</p>


<h3>FRENCH PASTRY</h3>

<p>French pastries are nationally popular and are very
attractive for tea or fancy dessert service. The maker
has wide scope for the display of individuality in devising
and decorating pastries. Slices of jelly roll, loaf or sponge
cake may be spread with mocha frosting to form individual
cakes. Fruit-filled tarts, topped with a bit of meringue,
are always popular. The real French pastry is made of puff
paste, very tender and flaky, and filled with fruit.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<h3>CAKE MAKING <span class="normal">(Continued from <a href="#Page_36">page 36</a>)</span></h3>


<h3>LEAVENING AGENTS</h3>

<p>Baking powder, soda and eggs are used as leavening
agents; this is to make the cake light. If the number of
eggs is increased in the cake recipe, decrease the amount
of baking powder. One egg is equivalent to one teaspoon
baking powder in leavening. Egg and milk together
should not exceed 1½ cups liquid with three cups flour.</p>


<h3>SHORTENING</h3>

<p>A large amount of fat makes a cake close-grained; a
small amount makes it porous, but it dries out easily. With
too much fat, the cake crumbles and it maybe heavy. If
melted fat is used in a cake, add it cool. If added hot, the
cake will be tough, coarse in grain and less light.</p>


<h3>LIQUID</h3>

<p>If water is substituted for milk, use seven-eighths cup of
water where one cup of milk is called for. If Veribest
Evaporated Milk is substituted for whole milk, use one-third
cup of evaporated milk and two-thirds cup of water. If
cream is substituted for milk, lessen the shortening and
use more cream than the milk called for.</p>


<h3>USE OF SOUR OR SWEET MILK</h3>

<p>Soda and acid both act on gluten and tend to make it
tender, so cakes made with sour milk or buttermilk will be
more tender than those made with water or sweet milk.
One scant teaspoonful of soda is necessary to neutralize a
cup of buttermilk or milk of the same sourness as buttermilk.
An excess of soda gives the product an unpleasant
flavor and, if present in too large a quantity, is injurious as
well.</p>

<p>Sour evaporated milk is very useful in cookery. Dilute
it as when sweet and add the necessary amount of soda
to the product in which it is to be used.</p>

<p>Muffins, griddle cakes and biscuits are better made
with sour milk than with sweet milk. Every bit of sour
evaporated milk may be used in this way.</p>

<p>Evaporated milk does not sour quickly because of the
thorough sterilization in heating to the temperature necessary
for evaporation.</p>

<p>A quality grade of evaporated milk will keep after
being open some four days before souring in warm weather
and over a week in cold weather.</p>

<p>Foods made with sour milk are characterized by a
particular softness of texture.</p>

<p>Cereals are economical, contain unusually good proportions
of necessary food ingredients with small proportion
of refuse, are readily prepared for the table, palatable,
digestible, compact, and easily preserved without
deterioration.</p>

<p>Rolled oats is perhaps the best-known of the cereals
and lends itself to the greatest variety of dishes, aside from
its popular use as a breakfast food.</p>

<p>Corn flakes are manufactured of the best pure white
corn, thoroughly toasted and ready to serve. Wheat flakes
are the whole wheat berry, flaked and toasted.</p>

<p>Macaroni, spaghetti, and egg noodles are made from
Durum wheat semolina, ground fine. Eggs are added to
the cereal for noodles.</p>

<p>Hominy grits and whole hominy are favorite American
breakfast cereals and combine well with other foods as the
main dish for the meal.</p>

<p>Among the staple food products, rice is one of the least
expensive and should appear frequently on the family bill
of fare.</p>

<p>Thorough cooking is the secret of the tasty and easily
digested dish of cereal. Cereals in bread, muffins, cookies,
cakes, croquettes, and in casseroles with cheese, fish, or
left-over meat; in the baking dish with a slice of ham, or
with a vegetable, they give variety to the menu and make
the preparation of the everyday dishes more interesting.</p>

<p>Stir cereals gradually into required quantity of boiling
water, allowing one teaspoon salt to each cup of cereal. Fine
granular cereals may be mixed first with a small amount
of cold water to prevent lumping, then add boiling water.
Stir flaky cereals with a fork. Cook rapidly at first over
flame five or ten minutes, then in double boiler. For prepared
cereals, allow plenty of time to cook thoroughly as
their palatability and ease of digestion depend largely on
this.</p>

<p>For variety, stir figs, dates or marmalade into cereals
before serving. Serve with canned fruits, baked apples,
or fresh fruits sliced over the cereal.</p>

<p>Cold cooked cereals may be sliced, dipped in flour, or
in eggs and crumbs and fried. In preparing corn meal
mush for frying, a little flour added to the corn meal will
make it slice more easily.</p>


<h3>SERVE MORE FRUITS</h3>

<p>During the season when fruits are plentiful serve them
plain, uncooked and well ripened. Small fruits and berries
should be thoroughly chilled. All fruits should be washed
and drained or wiped before serving. To wash berries,
place in a colander and pour water over them, handling
as little as possible. If washed under the faucet turn to a
small stream. Wash strawberries before removing the
stems, otherwise they will become water soaked.</p>


<h3>CANNED FRUITS</h3>

<p>Serve canned fruits with their juices as a dessert for
luncheon and dinner, as an appetizer for breakfast, in
cocktails for dinner, and in various desserts in which fruit
is used as a base. The flavor of canned fruit is improved
by removing from the can to a dish and allowing to stand
in the air one hour before using. The juice which is not
served with the fruit should be used in fruit gelatins,
sauces, or drinks. Do not waste any fruit juice.</p>

<p>Certain fruit juices contain a neutral substance called
pectin, which, when properly cooked, causes them to solidify
or jell. In this form much of our excess fruit and juices
are preserved. Apples, grapes, currants, cranberries, and
plums are the best known jell makers.</p>


<h3>GRAPEFRUIT AND ORANGE</h3>

<p>In preparing grapefruit to serve, chill the fruit
thoroughly, cut in two crosswise, remove the seeds with a
sharp pointed knife, remove the center, and, slipping the
knife down between rind and pulp, loosen all around without
cutting the tissue.</p>

<p>Bread can be made out of flour, water, yeast, and salt,
but usually a little fat and sugar are added to give additional
food value and flavor. Milk when used in place of water
makes a more nutritious bread, and the crust has a more
appetizing appearance.</p>

<p>Hard wheat flour, which is made from spring wheat
and contains a high percentage of gluten, is best for bread
making. Winter or soft wheat flour is used where a lighter,
more flaky product is desired.</p>


<div class="sidenote">QUALITIES
OF GOOD
BREAD</div>

<p>Good bread is sometimes described as porous
or containing a large number of holes,
all about the same size and shape. A loaf
of bread should be light in weight according
to its size and should be elastic and have a symmetrical
form and an unbroken golden crust.</p>


<div class="sidenote">POINTS TO
REMEMBER</div>

<p class="unindent">1. Use dependable materials and correct
utensils.</p>

<p class="unindent">2. Cleanliness. Exactness of proportions,
measuring, mixing and molding.</p>

<p class="unindent">3. Set bread to rise in a warm place. Keep it warm while
rising.</p>

<p class="unindent">4. Adjust oven temperature high at first to form crust,
then medium and steady.</p>

<p class="unindent">5. Cool loaves without steaming.</p>


<div class="sidenote">BAKING</div>

<p>Baking bread (1) kills the ferment (2) makes
starch soluble (3) drives off the alcohol and
carbon dioxide (4) forms brown crust of pleasant flavor.
Bread should be baked 45 minutes-1 hour in a moderate
oven at a temperature of 350°-400°. If the oven is too
hot, the crust will brown too quickly before the center of
the bread is baked. The first fifteen minutes of the baking,
the loaves should continue rising, then should brown and
continue browning for the next twenty minutes. The last
fifteen minutes should finish the baking.</p>

<p>After baking, the loaves should be removed from the
pans at once, and turned on their side on a wire bread or
cake cooler. If a soft crust is desired, brush with butter and
cover; if a crisp crust is preferred, allow the bread to cool
without covering.</p>


<h3>ROLLED OATS BREAD</h3>

<div class="center">Makes 3 loaves. Preparation 5 hours.</div>

<p>Pour two cups of scalded milk (or part milk and
part water) over one cup and a half of rolled oats, add two
tablespoons of sugar or molasses. When cooled to lukewarm,
add one-third a cake of compressed yeast, softened
and mixed with half a cup of lukewarm water, three cups
of whole wheat flour and two of white flour. Mix with a
knife to a dough, adding as much more flour as is required
to make a dough that may be kneaded. Knead until
smooth and elastic. Wash and butter the mixing bowl; in
it put the dough, carefully cover and set aside out of
draughts. When the dough is doubled in bulk, cut down
and shape into two loaves. When again nearly doubled
in bulk bake one hour.</p>

<h3>FAVORITE SOUTHERN DISHES</h3>


<h4>CREOLE SAUCE</h4>

<div class="center">Serves 5. Preparation 20 minutes. Medium in cost.</div>


<ul class="ingredients2">
<li>2 tablespoons chopped onion</li>
<li>4 tablespoons green pepper, finely chopped</li>
<li>2 tablespoons oleomargarine</li>
<li>2 tomatoes</li>
<li>¼ cup sliced mushrooms</li>
<li>6 olives, stoned</li>
<li>1⅓ cups brown sauce</li>
<li>Salt and pepper</li></ul>


<p>Cook onion and pepper with oleomargarine five minutes;
add tomatoes, mushrooms, and olives and cook two
minutes, then add brown sauce. Bring to boiling point and
serve hot. This can accompany fish, meat or vegetables.</p>


<h4>SMOTHERED CHICKEN</h4>

<div class="center">Serves 4. Preparation 1 hour 20 minutes. Inexpensive in season.</div>

<ul class="ingredients2">
<li>1 chicken</li>
<li>Seasonings</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Flour</li>
<li>Parsley</li></ul>

<p>This is a most delicate and palatable way of cooking
chicken. After cleaning the young chicken, split down
the back and dredge with salt and pepper. Put a tablespoonful
of lard into the frying pan, and, when it is hot,
add the chicken. Cook over slow fire fifteen minutes, then
add a half cup of water, and set back on the stove, and let
it simmer gently and steadily for about an hour. Serve
with a garnish of chopped parsley. Some smother the
chicken in butter, but this is according to taste.</p>


<h4>CORN FRITTERS</h4>

<div class="center">Serves 6. Preparation 45 minutes. Time to cook 15 minutes.
Economical.</div>

<ul class="ingredients2">
<li>1 can of corn</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>1 cupful of flour</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls baking powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of salt</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful of pepper</li>
</ul>


<p>Put the corn through a food chopper; add the well-beaten
eggs, flour, seasoning and baking powder. Mix
well and fry on a well-greased hot griddle or in deep fat.</p>


<h4>BEATEN BISCUIT</h4>

<div class="center">Serves 4. Preparation 1 hour. Economical.</div>

<ul class="ingredients2">
<li>2 cups flour</li>
<li>1 cup milk or water</li>
<li>2 tablespoons lard</li>
<li>½ teaspoonful salt</li></ul>

<p>Stir the flour and add the salt, mixing thoroughly;
then add the lard, and blend by rubbing through the hands
till not a lump remains in the flour. Now add gradually
the water or milk, or the milk and water combined, using
half and half of each, and knead all together till the
dough, which must not be too soft, but rather stiff, is
formed. Then lay the dough on a biscuit board on a block,
and beat for a half hour with a rolling pin. Knead lightly,
and beat again for a full ten minutes, till from every portion
of the surface and sides the air bubbles or “blisters”
form. A special biscuit beater simplifies this process.
Roll to quarter of an inch thick and cut round with round
cutter, or square with a knife, and stick here and there with
a fork. Bake in a moderate oven for about ten or fifteen
minutes, till a delicate brown above and below.</p>


<h4>SOUTHERN EGG BREAD</h4>

<div class="center">Serves 5. Preparation 25 minutes. Economical.</div>


<ul class="ingredients2">
<li>1 quart cornmeal</li>
<li>1 cup of milk (buttermilk if possible)</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of salt</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of butter</li></ul>

<p>Scald the cornmeal with boiling water, add butter, and
stir. Beat the yolks of the eggs very, very light. Add
the cornmeal and melted butter and the salt, and beat until
very light, moistening with the milk. Then add the whites
of the eggs, beaten to a stiff froth. Beat all well together.
Pour into shallow tins and bake quickly. This is the real
creole corn bread, so highly praised by all tourists through
Louisiana. The secret of the exquisite flavor depends
upon the proper beating of the eggs, as well as on the rising
of the corn bread itself. If the eggs are well beaten, the corn
bread will need neither soda nor baking powder to make
it rise properly. Some add a tablespoonful of sugar when
they wish to have sweetened corn bread. Corn bread, to
be delicious, should always be served hot and generously
buttered.</p>

<h2 class="faux">THE POPULAR SANDWICH</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 611px;">
<img src="images/i-050.jpg" width="611" height="99" alt="THE POPULAR SANDWICH" />
</div>



<div class="blockquot">

<p>The sandwich plays such an
important part in the diet that its
food value from the standpoint
of balanced ration is of interest. A sandwich, being composed
of slices of bread filled with meat or fruit and salad
dressing, constitutes a meal when coupled with a beverage.
All food principles are present and in the right proportions.
A sandwich embodies protein, carbohydrate, mineral matter
and fat.</p></div>

<p>Bread for sandwiches should be twenty-four hours old.
Remove all outside crusts or not, as desired, before slicing.
Slice very thin, for sandwiches should be dainty. Always
cream the butter. It not only goes farther, but spreads
more easily.</p>

<p>Cold sliced meats form dainty sandwiches of fine flavor.
Chopped pickles, olives, capers or other adjuncts improve
meat sandwiches by adding a tart, spicy flavor.</p>

<p>Butter is often mixed with creamed cheese, chopped
anchovies, or other material of like nature, to form sandwich
pastes for filling. An ordinary sized loaf of sandwich
bread should make between two and three dozen dainty
sandwiches. One-half pound of butter is allowed for
spreading this number of sandwiches.</p>

<h3>USE OF LEFT-OVERS</h3>

<p>Waste has no place in the substantial American home.
The wise home manager uses every bit of wholesome edible
product for food. She makes tasty dishes of all left-over
foods. A bit of extract of beef adds just the flavor necessary
to make many left-over meat and vegetable dishes
favorites with the family.</p>

<p>Left-over egg yolks are rich in fat and may be used
with skimmed milk in making custards, pudding sauces,
salad dressings, noodles and in soups or drinks. Left-over
whites may be used to clear coffee, consommé or bouillon.</p>

<p>Left-over bits of cheese are excellent as garnishes and
as flavoring for soups and milk sauces; they not only add
a great deal of fat, but some protein also. Cheese may be
grated, added to white sauce and served on toast. This
makes a fine, tasty luncheon dish.</p>

<h2 class="faux">FEEDING THE YOUNGER GENERATION</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 612px;">
<img src="images/i-052.jpg" width="612" height="71" alt="FEEDING THE YOUNGER GENERATION" />
</div>



<p>The fundamental principle in child feeding is the
gradual development of the digestive powers.</p>

<p>A normal child fed upon his mother’s milk doubles in
weight in the first six months of his life, largely because his
food is adapted to his needs. Never will he double his
weight so rapidly again.</p>

<p>Cow’s milk is the safe staple throughout the second
year. Milk is easily assimilated; its protein furnishes nitrogen
in the best form for muscle building, and its fat provides
the valuable vitamines. The mineral salts, so necessary to
bone formation, are also found in this valuable food. Great
care must be exercised to maintain clean, pure milk.</p>

<p>Eggs, cereals, orange juice, tomato juice, or other mild
fruit juices (a few spoonfuls at a time), round out the diet.</p>

<p>When the teeth are cut, stale bread or dry toast should
be added to the diet, to train the child to masticate.</p>

<p>When the children grow older they should be gradually
given a variety in diet and, above all, trained to eat what is
put before them without comment. Avoid monotony; children
as well as adults enjoy change in the form in which
food is served.</p>

<p>A normal child three to four years old needs 1100-1400
calories of food per day; at the age of five, 1435-1517 calories
are required; at the age of six, 1530-1575 calories; and at
seven, 1600-1700 calories, according to weight.</p>

<p>Milk and eggs continue to supply the necessary protein,
even after green vegetables are introduced, and a plain,
simple dessert may be served at the end of a meal.</p>

<p>Each day’s menus should contain some protective foods.
Breakfast is an important meal for the school child
and should be given early so the child is not hurried or
worried by fear of being late. Many children do poor work
in school because they are not sufficiently nourished, and
frequently the meager breakfast is at fault. A regular meal
schedule should now be established and strictly adhered
to. Irregularity is a grave error in child feeding.</p>

<p>Milk, to the extent of a quart a day, should be continued
up to the twelfth year. Evaporated milk contains
all the food properties of fresh milk.</p>

<h3>CARE OF FOOD IN THE HOME</h3>

<p><i>Much waste of food is due to carelessness in handling after it is delivered in the home. Thus the benefits of the
elaborate care exercised in bringing the food to the consumer are sometimes lost by the carelessness of the housewife.</i></p>

<p>Few of us realize the patient care and ofttimes burdensome
labor incident to food production. The long
hours of labor necessary to produce food in any form
should give us a wholesome respect for it when it comes
into our kitchen all ready to form a part of the family diet.</p>

<p>In case of vegetable foods, the preparation of the soil,
selection of seed, the planting, care while growing, harvesting
and perhaps threshing, all demand great care and
much labor upon the part of the farmer and his family.</p>

<p>The food product ready, it is put to one of two uses—fed
to the live stock from which we obtain our milk, butter,
cheese, meat and meat products, or it is sent to factories
where by means of much more labor and care it is further
prepared for our table. By canning, as in case of fruits
and vegetables, by milling of grains, or, if the product is a
meat animal, by the many complicated processes of packing,
the food is prepared for transportation.</p>

<p>Perishable foods must be cared for in cold storage and
transported in refrigerator cars, all of which occupies the
time and energy of thousands of people.</p>

<p>Next, the retailer adds his services, and the article
which has cost so much in money and energy is finally delivered
in the home in good condition.</p>

<p>It is the duty of the housewife to unpack and properly
put away all foods as soon as they are delivered.</p>

<p>Place butter, milk, oleomargarine, shortenings, and
frying mediums, eggs, and meat, as well as other perishables,
in appropriate receptacles and put them in the refrigerator.
Meat should be unwrapped, placed on a plate and
set in the refrigerator, but never directly on ice. Fresh
salad materials should be cleaned, wiped dry, and put in a
salad bag, in a cool place.</p>

<p>Place cereals, syrups, coffee, tea, spices, baking powder,
salt, extracts and all canned foods upon the pantry shelf
or in the convenient kitchen cabinet.</p>

</div>



<p>To observe the rules given for maid service when without a maid,
would be an unnecessary tax upon one’s time and strength. The serving
can be done nicely if attention be paid to certain points.</p>

<p>To avoid disturbance and frequent rising from the table, all foods which the temperature of the rooms will not affect should be placed
upon the table or the serving table.</p>

<p>It is a good plan to have some young member of the family circle perform what service is required. For this kind of service it is permissible
to remove plates or dishes two at a time, one in each hand, and to leave a person without a plate. This is, of course, contrary to
conventional service.</p>


<h3>A FEW STANDARD RULES FOR SERVING</h3>

<p>1. Pass and place everything from the left, except
beverages and extra silver belonging on the right.</p>

<p>2. Place and remove plates one at a time. To save
time, two plates may be brought to the dining room.
Place one on the serving table and the other on the dining
table; return to the serving table for the second plate,
rather than to the pantry.</p>

<p>3. Use a folded napkin in the hand under all dishes
served which contain food.</p>

<p>4. Use a tray only when passing or removing more
than one article, as cream and sugar, or salt and pepper.</p>

<p>5. In removing a course, first take all dishes containing
food, then soiled plates and silver.</p>

<p>6. Special watchfulness should be given by the maid
that each person’s needs are attended to.</p>

<p>7. Two pieces of silver placed on a platter containing
food to be served are more convenient than one, for the
person serving himself.</p>

<p>8. No sound of preparation should come from the
pantry.</p>

<p>9. Hot dishes must come to the table hot and served
on hot plates. Cold dishes must be cold and served on
cold plates.</p>

<p>10. A maid should always wear a clean fresh dress
and apron.</p>


<h3>PREPAREDNESS MAKES DOING EASY</h3>

<p>The great majority of the American housewives do
their own work.</p>

<p>A bit of hourly help now and then is the extent of help
in thousands of representative homes.</p>

<p>To be able to prepare a perfect meal, have the house in
order, the children happy and spotless, the table attractively
set, and to serve the meal oneself at the same time retaining
one’s poise, occupying the hostess’ place at the table,
directing the conversation and creating a feeling of true
hospitality is, perhaps, the greatest test of one’s generalship.</p>

<p>These suggestions will help make the accomplishments
a pleasure.</p>

<div class="unindent"><b>The “Day Before”</b></div>

<p>1. Plan menu and do all buying excepting fresh salad
materials.</p>

<p>2. Prepare as much as possible of the company meal.</p>

<p>3. Put the house in order.</p>

<p>4. See that all silver, china, glassware and linen is in
perfect condition.</p>

<p>1. Set the children at an interesting game early in
the day where they will be free to romp. They will then
want a rest at your busy time.</p>

<p>2. Think what a joy these guests are to be and how
happy you want to make everyone.</p>

<p>3. Do necessary finishing touches, arranging decorations,
and rest ten minutes, enjoying your anticipated pleasure
before beginning the actual preparation of the meal.</p>

<p>4. Manage a rest period of twenty minutes before
dressing for dinner, and call to mind a few amusing incidents
to relate.</p>

<p>The ideal hostess is never tired or worried and has a
fund of interesting conversation.</p>


<h3>THE THREE FORMS OF TABLE SERVICE</h3>

<p>1. The Russian Service is most formal. No food is
on the table except candy and nuts. All serving is done
from the pantry or the serving table. The food is attractively
arranged upon suitable dishes from which each
person helps himself; or portions may be arranged upon
plates, one of which is placed before each person. The
former method is preferable.</p>

<p>2. The English Service is informal. The food is
placed upon the table and served by those seated at the
head and the foot. If one has a maid, the passing is done
by her; if not, by those sitting at the table.</p>

<p>3. The Mixed Service is a combination of the two
mentioned and requires the service of a waitress. Some
of the courses are served “from the side” (Russian), and
some “from the table” (English). Frequently the meat is
served from the table and the accompanying vegetables
served from the side (Russian).</p>

<p>The body needs food to keep it warm, to furnish energy
for the activities of daily life; to build and repair
tissue and to regulate the body process.</p>

<p>Proteins, fats, carbohydrates, mineral matter, and
water, are the chief classes of food. The chief work of
proteins is to build and repair tissue. Meat and milk are
the principal sources of protein. Nuts, vegetables and
some cereals also supply this element.</p>

<p>Carbohydrates are the starches and sugars. They are
found in vegetables, cereals, and fruits and give heat and
energy to the body. Fats give two and a half times as
much energy as any other food.</p>

<p>Mineral matters enter into the composition of the body
tissues and blood. They act as regulators, preserving the
alkalinity of the body. They are found in varying proportions
in all foods, but milk contains all the essential ones.</p>

<p>Vitamines are necessary for growth and are abundant
in leafy vegetables and milk. Foods rich in vitamine
content are known as protective foods. They prevent
the development of deficiency and old age diseases.</p>

<p>Water is necessary as a carrier and regulator. It aids digestion,
removes waste, and keeps the temperature normal.</p>


<h4>Balanced Rations</h4>

<p>A general balance of food should be maintained in each
day’s diet: 1/5th meat or meat alternatives, 1/5th fat, and
3/5ths carbohydrates, with a serving of fruits and vegetables
and plenty of liquid, completes the necessary variety.</p>


<h3>WHERE THE CALORIE COMES IN</h3>

<p>Before assimilation, the food we eat must be oxidized or
burned. The heat resulting from this oxidation is measured
in terms of calories, or heat units.</p>

<p>While the number of calories supplied by the diet is important,
the proper balance as to the classification of the food
is of prime importance. We cannot build up the diet on calorie
values alone without consideration of the food elements.</p>

<h3>PROTECTIVE FOODS</h3>

<p>The responsibility for the correct development of a
family rests more and more surely at the door of the one
who plans and cooks the meals for that family.</p>

<p>Nutrition experts are continually making careful tests
and giving us valuable information through the newspapers
and women’s national publications. With such easy
access to the fundamentals of correct eating, it comes close
to criminal negligence for a mother to feed her family improperly;
the present percentage of under-nourished children
is appalling, and many of these are in the homes of the
well-to-do.</p>

<p>The most important “food finding” of the year has been
the information given the public
regarding Protective Foods, sometimes
called dietetic ferments or the
foods rich in the vitamines that promote
growth and those rich in the
vitamines that protect one from deficiency
diseases such as scurvy,
beriberi, pellagra and less dangerous
skin diseases.</p>

<p>Milk and its products, butter and
cheese, are foremost growth promotors. In this class comes
also the yolk of eggs, glandular meats, and grains with the
living germ still intact. Leafy vegetables, such as spinach,
lettuce, cabbage, chard, cauliflower, kale, all greens, water
cress, onions, string beans, and a few others are classed with
protective foods.</p>

<p>While Professor McCullom does not yet definitely list
the tomato under protective foods, it is found to have valuable
protective qualities, often being substituted for orange
juice in preventing scurvy in baby feeding. The protective
substance of the tomato is not easily destroyed.</p>

<p>Experiments are continually being completed which
add new foods to this important group.</p>

<h3>TIME AND TEMPERATURE</h3>

<p>It will not be long before thermometers will be generally
used as kitchen appliances. Until then we must show
how we may know when a food is cooked, instead of stating
the exact number of minutes required. It is better in
most cases to subject foods to a moderate heat for a long
time, than to intense heat for a shorter period. The shape
and size of the article to be cooked and the variety and
age of fruit or vegetables must be considered.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
